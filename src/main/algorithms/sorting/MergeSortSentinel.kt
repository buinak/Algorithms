/**
 * Merge Sort using Sentinels - Int.MAX_VALUE entries when merging lists.
 * Allows to eliminate checks for whether the left/right list are fully added to the original list.
 * Performs better than plain merge sort at the cost of extra O(2 (log N)) auxiliary memory.
 *
 * Time complexity per case:
 *      Best, Average, Worst - O(n log n), logarithmic.
 *
 * Space complexity:
 *      Auxiliary O(n) memory.
